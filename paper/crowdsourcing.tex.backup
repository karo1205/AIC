% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to
% Gerald Murray ---> murray@hq.acm.org
%
% For tracking purposes - this is V3.1SP - APRIL 2009

%\subtitle{}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{3} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

  % You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
  % e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
  % and a second row of one, two or three).
  %
  % The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
  % precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
  % e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
  % affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
\textit{The paper should provide an overview about the scientific state of the art in crowdsourcing. Note
that the paper is not the documentation of your tool – it should discuss scientific papers related
to this topic in the style of a seminar paper. Good starting points for finding related scientific
papers are the sources cited in this text, Google Scholar 6 , IEEEXplorer 7 or the ACM Digital
Library 8 . Use the ACM ’tight’ conference style 9 (two columns), and keep it brief (3 pages). You
do not necessarily need to install a LaTeX environment for this - you can use writeLaTeX 10 , a
collaborative paper writing tool as well.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}

\begin{quote} 
  Definition of crowdsourcing
\end{quote}

Write something useful about how crowdsourcing has been developed over time, history and the like.
Come then to the current state of the topic and give a brief overview about the (possible) future.

%/footnote{some text in here}

\section{History of crowdsourcing}
\label{sect:history}
The term ``crowdsourcing'' has been coined by the american journalist Jeff Howe \cite{howe:rise}. It has first been mentioned in the article ``The Rise Of Crowdsourcing'', published in the Wired Magazin\footnote{http://www.wired.com}. \\
In this article Howe describes that and why crowd sourcing may be the next big thing in the internet 2.0. He connects the term ``outcourcing'' (giving work to well known and specialized group of persons) with ``crowdsourcing'', meaning that the group of participants is open. The transition from outsourcing to crowdsourcing is done by examples like a site named iStockphoto\footnote{http://www.istockphoto.com}, which raised by a image-sharing community. iSockphoto's micro-payment system allows a large community of more or less professional photographers to sell their pictures. Although this might not be a crowdsourcing system as it has been defined it certainly leads to it.\\
However crowdsourcing is much older and is not necessarily related to the internet. In the past crowdsourcing has often been used as a competition in order to discover a solution. The following examples are by no means complete and shall just show that crowdsourcing type of work has been around for a long time before the term has been established and even before the internet exists.
\subsection*{The longitude price}
In 1714 the British Government offered  to a solution to a problem named \textit{The Longitude Problem} \footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude\_prize/}. Sailing was very dangerous at this times. One of the problems was to measure the current longitude. Eventually John Harrison won the main price by inventing the chronometer. Several other persons also benefited from the offer.\\
It shall be mentioned that quite similar offers have been done even earlier, in the late 16\textsuperscript{th} century but by then nobody could solve the problems.
\subsection*{Toyota Logo Contest}
In 1963 Toyota held a contest to design a new logo. They received about 25.000 entries. The winning one was the well known three ellipses.
\subsection*{Youtube, Wikipedia ...}
With the rise of the internet collaborative sites like youtube and wikipedia rose as well. The connection to the field of crowdsourcing is obvious: a large group of people invest time and effort to create a larger whole.

\subsection{Prominent crowdsourcing sites}
In general crowdsourcing means that a group of ``workers'' participate in finding a solution to a given problem, mostly by solving small parts of the problem. There are several web sites online which provide the technical and logistical infrastructure to support this kind of problem solving. We provided list is by no means complete but shall rather give a brief overview. Different sites cover different more or less specialized aspects of crowd sourcing (see Section~\ref{sect:types}).
\subsection*{Freelancer.com\footnote{http://www.freelancer.com/}}
This site offers online jobs to freelancers who bid on projects or problems posted by companies or individuals on a set price. The kind of problems to solve range from programming tasks to design projects. Similar web sites are for example ScriptLance\footnote{http://www.scriptlance.com}, Elance\footnote{http://www.elance.com} or guru\footnote{http://www.guru.com})
\subsection*{CrowdSpring\footnote{https://www.crowdspring.com}}
A site specialized to graphic design projects. Similar sites are: 99designs\footnote{http://99designs.com/} or hatchwise\footnote{http://www.hatchwise.com}.
\subsection*{Utest\footnote{https://www.utest.com}}
This site offers software testing, that relies on crowdsourcing. Similar pages are: UserTesting\footnote{http://www.usertesting.com}, Feedback Army\footnote{http://feedbackarmy.com} (for web sites) and others.
\subsection*{Amazon Mechanical Turk\footnote{https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome}}
One of the best known crowdsourcing sites. Best suited for small and simple tasks like finding or extracting of certain information, tagging pictures... Each task is really simple and donated by just a few cent.
\subsection*{InnoCentive\footnote{http://www.innocentive.com/}}

Those are just a few of many, many crowdsourcing sites in the internet. A comprehensive list can be found at \href{http://www.crowdsourcing.org/directory}{www.crowdsourcing.org}.
